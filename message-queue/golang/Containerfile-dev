# This is very silly. The thing is, my .zshrc points GOPATH to ~/.local/go and
# that is what gets used in the development container since that is an
# interactive shell.
# However, the problem is when running in GHA which runs in non-interactive
# posix sh and as far as I can tell there is no profile file for
# non-interactive/non-login shell for dash sh.
# Anyway, we are just gonna continue with GOPATH unset in sh and symlink the
# one from my zshrc to the default one so it works in both.
